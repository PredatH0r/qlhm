# Quake Live Hook Manager (QLHM)


**IMPORTANT:** To download `hook.js`, see the [Version History](https://github.com/supahgreg/qlhm/wiki/Version-History) wiki page.


## What QLHM is

* A client-side `hook.js` file used to allow many [userscripts](http://userscripts.org) to run in the standalone [QUAKE LIVE](http://www.quakelive.com) client
* A server-side [node.js](http://nodejs.org) application which provides a JSONP interface to manage (i.e. retrieve, cache, check for updates) scripts from [userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org)

**NOTE:** The vast majority of users will only need the `hook.js` script.  Refer to the [Installation](#installation) section.


## What QLHM is not

* A perfect replacement for a proper userscript engine (e.g. Scriptish, Greasemonkey)


## TODO

* [A lot](https://github.com/supahgreg/qlhm/issues)... this is a very early release, so expect major
issues and breaking changes.


## Want to contribute/help/say thanks?

* Subscribe to QUAKE LIVE if you're able.  The `hook.js` script gets loaded thanks to those guys.
* Good pull requests are welcome.  There is a lot to be done and rewritten.
* [Report a bug](https://github.com/supahgreg/qlhm/issues), but check if it has already been reported.
* Help others work through the many issues that are bound to occur using QLHM.
* Join the QLHM IRC channel: #qlhm @ irc.quakenet.org ([webchat](http://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=qlhm))


## How to use

1. Follow the [client installation instructions](#installation) below
2. Open the QUAKE LIVE standalone client
3. Click on the QLHM "HOOK" menu (to the lower-left of the QUAKE LIVE logo)
4. Under the "New" section enter the [userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org) script ID (the number in the URL)
or a comma-delimited list of script IDs and click "Apply".
  * Alternatively, check the desired boxes in the provided userscript list and click "Apply".

**TIP:** To install [QLRanks.com Display](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/111519) (111519),
[Quake Live Stream Notifier](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/114449) (114449),
and [Quake Live New Alt Browser](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/73076) (73076) in one go simply
enter "111519,114449,73076" and click "Save".

**NOTE:** The server-side app is running on wn's server.  If you'd prefer to run your own, feel free
to modify `config.BASE_URL` in "hook.js".

(within "hook.js") or come up with a creative alternative.
